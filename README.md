# Disassembler++

A proof-of-concept stand-alone disassembler with several useful functions that can be used for analysis and modification of portable executable files.
Also includes an x86 opcode shellcode to assembly feature.

## Description

As part of my Master's degree final year project, I proposed the design and implementation of a proof-of-concept stand-alone disassembler which automates the process of converting binary code of portable executable (PE) files into human-readable assembly instructions. 
The program also includes several features demonstrating multiple ways of analysing and manipulating PE files programmatically.
